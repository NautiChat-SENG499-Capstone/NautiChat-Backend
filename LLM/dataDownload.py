        Get the deviceCategoryCode at a certain locationCode at Cambridge Bay in a dataProduct with an extension,
        so that users request to download data, over a specified time period.
        Returns a result of a data download request.

        This function simply queues a download from ONC, and gives no additional information to the LLM.
        If this function is called, the LLM will only provide the parameters the user has explicitly given.
        Do not guess, assume, or invent any missing parameters.
        If parameters are missing, the function will handle asking the user for them.

        If the request is successful, it means the download has been queued â€” it does not mean the data will actually be delivered successfully.
        The LLM is not responsible for interpreting the result or following up.

        Returns:
            result (str): The result of the download request. It will either signify that the request has been queued,
                        that required parameters are missing, or that the request was unsuccessful.

        Args:
            deviceCategoryCode (str): An ONC-defined code identifying the type of device 
                                    (e.g., DIVE_COMPUTER, NAV, ROV_CAMERA, ACOUSTICRECEIVER, ADCP1200KHZ).
            locationCode (str): An ONC-defined code identifying the location of the device 
                                (e.g., 'CBYDS' for the Cambridge Bay Diver data or 'CBYIP' for the Cambridge Bay Underwater Network or 'CBYSP' for the Cambridge Bay Safe Passage Buoy or 'CBYSS' for the Cambridge Bay Shore Station).
            dataProductCode (str): An ONC-defined code identifying the type of data being requested 
                                (e.g., 'LF' for Log File, 'TSSD' for Time Series Scalar Data).
            extension (str): The file format of the data product to be delivered 
                            (e.g., 'csv', 'pdf', 'jpg', 'zip', 'flac', 'mp4', etc.).
            dateFrom (str): The start date of the data request in ISO 8601 format 
                            (e.g., '2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z'). (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ)
            dateTo (str): The end date of the data request in ISO 8601 format 
                    (e.g., '2016-09-30T23:59:59.999Z'). (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ)
